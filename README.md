##Two-paragraph summary
Both models agree on a handful of key drivers but differ in how they rank secondary predictors. In logistic regression, the top five positive drivers of churn (highest positive coefficients) are SatisfactionScore, Offer E, PaperlessBilling, TenureMonths, and NumDependents. In other words, higher satisfaction scores and longer tenures actually correspond to a higher likelihood of churn, while add-ons like paperless billing and being on “Offer E” each raise churn‐odds by roughly 1.5–1.8×. On the negative side (protecting from churn), features such as having Dependents (≥1), Streaming TV, and OnlineBackup dramatically reduce churn probability (odds-ratios well under 0.2). Logistics confirms that multi-year contracts (one- and two-year) cut churn by ~40–60 % and that older age also strongly protects against attrition.

In the random forest, SatisfactionScore is again the most important feature by far, capturing more than 50 % of total Gini‐gain in tree splits. TenureMonths and Age follow next, underscoring that how long a customer has been subscribed and their age bracket are pivotal retention drivers. Multi-year contracts appear in the top five RF splits, and payment method (especially “Electronic check”) ranks within the top six. Secondary RF signals include Dependents, OnlineSecurity, and StreamingMovies, reflecting similar loyal segments identified by logistics. Overall, RF confirms the non‐linear importance of satisfaction, tenure and age, while LR quantifies exact odds‐multipliers for each feature. Together, these outputs suggest that loyalty campaigns should target mid-tenure and mid-satisfaction segments, push multi-year deals, and bundle streaming/security services to minimize churn.
